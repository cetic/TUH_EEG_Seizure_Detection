CLINICAL HISTORY: This is a 41-year-old male with a history of recurrent astrocytoma in the right hemisphere with a resection x 2, admitted for increasing seizures.
MEDICATIONS: Dilantin, Phenobarbital, Baclofen, and Pantoprazole.

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed at the bedside in the long-term monitoring unit using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG is low voltage with nearly continuous T4 spike and slow wave activity.  Similarly, in the previous LTM recording, there are 27 epileptiform discharges recorded and these discharges were correlated with clinical seizure activity, which started from the left arm to the right arm. At that time, his face was turned to the right.  Generalized tonic-clonic seizures include both legs.  Subsequently, he started shaking in the right arm and then the right leg and left arm shaking but in a different rhythm.  This lasted for about two to three minutes.  He did not have a postictal phase, but rather started talking and continued his spontaneous movement.  There is a total of 27 spells recorded.  Again, some tracing revealed high spike activity before generalized epileptiform discharges.
HR:  84 BPM.
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
Frequent epileptiform discharges, which correlated with seizure activity.
Nearly continuous T4 spike waves.
Low voltage background.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: This abnormal EEG tracing demonstrates status epilepticus, which includes generalized tonic-clonic and complex partial epilepsy.  The left temporal continuous spike activity may be suggestive of a local pathology for the seizure activity.  This study is similar to previous LTM tracings.
